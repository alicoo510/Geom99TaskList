# Playing with qFields
## try to make your own project and upload onto the app on your phone
this may be a good open source app to use if there was not available ESRi licenses for the project. for our collab though they have full esri licensing so i think i will stick to using more of the ArcGIS online applications like field maps or survey 123.

Need to regester on lie to start with their qFiledCloud
