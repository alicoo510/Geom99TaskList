> in the future i can also add in my own base map instead of using the one from ESRI i have to upload it from pro into tiles and i could change the base map and make a custome on for the collection app. there is a way to add layers into the map either base or feature layers

Map tours are a good way of showing the collected data on a story map you can link the field map application to the story map and show the data to the side works especially well if the data that was colelcted has images attached
