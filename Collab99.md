feedback was not good need to change probem statement to reflect study area (Changing KAwartha LAkes to Ajax instead)
or to change the data source to fake data made up by us instead of actually useing open source data though i think we need a real data set and to just change the area to Ajax that shows the tree ownership rather than to display fake tree data.
Revised Problem statement by me:
a public use web application (Dashboard) that allows the public to view tree discriptions and tree ownsership for the city of Ajax.
there is no dashboard application that allows the general public to view collected city tree data  specifically tree ownership information. Ownership is important to tree maintenance.
lack of knwledge about trees in the area, no understanding of tree dispersal within the city, or tree location and ownership, could casue disputes about who can remove trees. public can not interact with city owned trees.          People cutting down city owned trees which results in fines.
showing trees and their ownership status as city trees solving the probelm of tree ownership, whether or not people can cut down these trees or need city assistance to interact with the trees. this web application will allow the public to know which trees are theirs and which trees are city trees.
